My plan is to ban the mouse out of my daily use System's and be productive too.
In this Post i present some tools that can help me do that.

Daily work, so what do i have to tweak?
The Web Browser is startet with the login of course and then there is the Text
Editing that has to be taken care of. Music and other tools have to be managed.
One still can't throw away the graphical power browsers but i found some tools
to take care of the first steps into mouseless using your computer.

As i reviewed in one of my Posts.
