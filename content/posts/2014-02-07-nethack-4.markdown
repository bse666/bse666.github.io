There are many clones in the Nethack Community.
Here is one that i learned to love the most.

[dynahack](http://tung.github.io/DynaHack/) is the way to go.
Download the latest source or git clone it.

```
git clone https://github.com/tung/DynaHack
cd DynaHack
sudo apt-get install gcc flex bison libncursesw5-dev libjansson-dev \
zlib1g-dev cmake cmake-curses-gui
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
ccmake .
```

Set SHELLDIR and CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to /home/username/dynahack/install.

Set BINDIR, DATADIR and LIBDIR to /home/username/dynahack/install/dynahack-data.

Press 'c' to configure, then 'g' to generate the build files and exit.

```
make install
```

And now have a blast shredding through the dungeons.
<SHIFT-S> saves the game.
