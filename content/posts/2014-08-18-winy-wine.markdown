Getting things done with wine on linux is cool, but you have to seperate working
directories if you want to be able to cleanly remove or install another
application side by side. Here i have a few tips for you to make yout first
steps into that.

``` bash
WINEPREFIX="$HOME/prefix32" WINEARCH='win32' wine 'wineboot'
WINEPREFIX="$HOME/prefix32" WINEARCH='win32' winetricks vcredist2005
```
